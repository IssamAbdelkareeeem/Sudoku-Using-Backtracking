**Backtracking Algorithm**
Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’, the goal is to assign 
digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and 
sub grid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 
to 9.

**File Input**    
grid = {{ 3, 1, 6, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 2 }, 
       { 5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 8 }, 
       { 4, 8, 7, 6, 2, 9, 5, 3, 1 }, 
       { 2, 6, 3, 0, 1, 5, 9, 8, 7 }, 
       { 9, 7, 4, 8, 6, 0, 1, 2, 5 }, 
       { 8, 5, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 4, 3 }, 
       { 1, 3, 8, 0, 4, 7, 2, 0, 6 }, 
       { 6, 9, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 7, 4 }, 
       { 7, 4, 5, 0, 8, 6, 3, 1, 0 }};
